# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
