# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify CIFAR-10 images. The notebook includes data loading, visualization, model building, training, and evaluation phases. The CNN architecture is designed to handle the challenges posed by the small size and similarities of the images.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Data visualization with random sample images
- CNN model building using TensorFlow and Keras
- Model training with early stopping
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy and confusion matrix

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/CIFAR10_Image_Classification_CNN.git
